  title: "The Dark Side Of The Moon",
  notes:
    '"The Dark Side Of The Moon" is the eighth studio LP to be released by Pink Floyd. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, England and released in 1973. It stands as one of the most successful commercial recordings of all time, and has been released in many countries. In the U.S., the album has spent more time on the Billboard 200 album chart than any other release in modern history.\r\n\r\nEarly releases included two posters and two color stickers inside the gatefold sleeve, all designed by the U.K. graphics and design company Hipgnosis.\r\n\r\nThe most sought-after and valuable version of DSOTM is the original U.K. Harvest issue ([r=1873013]), identifiable with a solid blue prism on the labels instead of the shaded triangle used on most other versions.\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 2020 the MR first reached the threshold of 1000 different versions and is currently hovering around that number, making it one of the most populated MRs in the entire database. Most of the vinyl versions were issued with gatefold sleeves. However, there are several versions with significant differences in packaging and design, such as this version: [r=1443030] from the Philippines which has the artist\'s name and LP title printed in large text on a non-gatefold sleeve. New and previously undocumented versions of DSOTM get added to the database frequently making it one of the most interesting titles to focus on for "deep collectors".\r\n\r\nPerformed by:\r\n[a110863] – vocals, guitars, Synthi AKS\r\n[a246097] – drums, percussion, tape effects\r\n[a110862] – bass guitar, vocals, VCS 3, tape effects\r\n[a110861] – organ (Hammond and Farfisa), piano, electric piano (Wurlitzer, Rhodes), EMS VCS 3, Synthi AKS, vocals\r\n\r\nSnippets of speech attributed by Nick Mason ("Inside Out - A Personal History of Pink Floyd") to:\r\n- Henry McCullough - guitarist with Paul McCartney: "I don\'t know, I was really drunk at the time."\r\n- Gerry O\'Driscoll - Abbey Road doorman: "There is no dark side of the moon. Matter of fact, it\'s all dark."',
